# MEDVault - Comprehensive Insurance System Architecture

MEDVault is a complete healthcare insurance ecosystem designed to handle the full complexity of coverage determination, from enrollment through appeals. This system captures every rule, edge case, and stakeholder interaction in the modern insurance landscape.

## 🎯 What's Inside

This repository contains a **production-ready insurance system** with:

### Core Components
- **Payer Profiles**: Machine-readable configurations for all major insurance types (Medicare, Medicaid, Commercial, VA/TRICARE)
- **Rule Engine**: Complete business logic for authorization, benefits, network, and formulary management  
- **Questionnaire System**: Systematic capture of provider and patient friction points
- **Denial Management**: Automated appeal processes with evidence-based strategies
- **NSA Compliance**: No Surprises Act implementation with patient liability calculation

### Supported Insurance Types
- **Medicare**: Parts A/B/C/D, Medicare Advantage, Medigap
- **Medicaid**: Fee-for-service and Managed Care Organizations (MCOs)
- **Commercial**: PPO, HMO, EPO, POS, HDHP/HSA, fully-insured and self-funded ERISA
- **Government**: VA, TRICARE, Workers' Comp, Auto PIP
- **Specialty**: Student plans, short-term limited duration

### Advanced Features
- **Edge Case Handling**: Observation vs inpatient, global periods, accumulator programs
- **Financial Guarantees**: Bond tracking for DMEPOS, TPA, and MCO requirements
- **Quality Integration**: HEDIS, Medicare Stars, risk adjustment
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Complete ecosystem relationship management

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Explore Payer Profiles**: Check `/payer-profiles/` for example configurations
2. **Review Rule Engine**: See `/rules/` for business logic components
3. **Test Scenarios**: Run through `/examples/` for real-world use cases
4. **Configure System**: Adapt profiles and rules for your environment

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system processes insurance coverage through these stages:

1. **Eligibility & Benefits**: Real-time verification with 270/271 transactions
2. **Authorization Management**: Prior auth requirements with medical necessity criteria
3. **Service Delivery**: Clinical care with proper coding and documentation
4. **Claims Processing**: Automated adjudication with edit checking
5. **Benefit Calculation**: Cost-sharing determination with network rules
6. **Appeals Management**: Multi-level review with external oversight

## 🔧 Key Differentiators

### Complete Edge Case Coverage
- **Accumulator Programs**: Copay assistance impact on deductibles
- **Stop-loss Lasering**: Individual member risk management
- **Global Periods**: Surgical bundling and follow-up complexity
- **Transplant Networks**: Specialized carve-out handling

### Real-world Complexity
- **Definition Drift**: Medical necessity criteria versioning
- **Policy Carve-outs**: Benefit variations within same plan
- **NSA Protection**: Balance billing prevention and IDR arbitration
- **Bond Requirements**: Financial guarantee tracking

### Production-Ready Features
- **Schema Validation**: JSON Schema compliance for all data
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Complete ecosystem relationship tracking  
- **Quality Integration**: HEDIS/Stars/Risk Adjustment support
- **Audit Trails**: Complete documentation and evidence tracking
