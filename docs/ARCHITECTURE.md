# MEDVault System Architecture

## System Design Overview

The MEDVault insurance machine follows a layered architecture pattern designed for scalability, maintainability, and regulatory compliance.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer
- **Web Portal**: Customer self-service interface
- **Mobile Applications**: Native iOS/Android apps
- **Agent Desktop**: Broker and agent tools
- **Administrative Dashboard**: Internal operations interface

### 2. API Gateway Layer
- **Authentication & Authorization**: OAuth 2.0, JWT token management
- **Rate Limiting**: API throttling and quota management
- **Request Routing**: Load balancing and service discovery
- **Protocol Translation**: REST, GraphQL, WebSocket support

### 3. Business Logic Layer
- **Underwriting Service**: Risk assessment and policy approval
- **Claims Processing Service**: End-to-end claims management
- **Policy Management Service**: Policy lifecycle operations
- **Premium Calculation Service**: Pricing algorithms and adjustments
- **Compliance Service**: Regulatory requirement enforcement

### 4. Data Access Layer
- **Policy Repository**: Policy and coverage data
- **Claims Database**: Claims history and processing status
- **Customer Data Store**: Policyholder information
- **Document Management**: Policy documents and forms
- **Audit Log**: Transaction and change tracking

### 5. Integration Layer
- **Third-Party APIs**: External data sources and services
- **Message Queues**: Asynchronous processing (Apache Kafka)
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time data processing
- **Batch Processing**: Scheduled jobs and bulk operations

### 6. Infrastructure Layer
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes deployment
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for inter-service communication
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack
- **Security**: Vault for secrets management, network policies

## Data Flow Architecture

### Policy Application Flow
```
Customer Application → API Gateway → Underwriting Service → Risk Assessment APIs → Policy Repository → Customer Notification
```

### Claims Processing Flow
```
Claim Submission → Claims Service → Investigation Workflow → Settlement Calculation → Payment Processing → Case Closure
```

### Premium Calculation Flow
```
Risk Factors → Pricing Engine → Actuarial Models → Market Adjustments → Premium Quote → Policy Terms
```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all sensitive operations
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission management
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: SAML 2.0 and OAuth 2.0 support
- **Session Management**: Secure token handling and rotation

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Data Masking**: PII protection in non-production environments
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for key storage

### Compliance Framework
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Annual compliance audits
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry standards
- **GDPR**: European data protection regulations
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare information privacy (for health insurance)

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot, Python Flask/Django
- **Frontend**: React.js, Angular, Vue.js
- **Mobile**: React Native, Flutter
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ
- **Search**: Elasticsearch
- **Analytics**: Apache Spark, Apache Flink

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform
- **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Service Mesh**: Istio
- **API Management**: Kong, AWS API Gateway
- **Monitoring**: Datadog, New Relic, or native cloud monitoring

## Implementation Considerations

### Scalability
The architecture supports horizontal scaling across all layers, ensuring the system can handle growing policy volumes and claim processing demands.

### Security
Multi-layered security approach with encryption at rest and in transit, comprehensive access controls, and regular security audits.

### Compliance
Built-in compliance frameworks ensure adherence to insurance regulations across multiple jurisdictions.

### Performance
Optimized for sub-second response times in policy operations and real-time claims processing capabilities.
