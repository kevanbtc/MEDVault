- **Site-of-Service**: Cost optimization and steerage logic
- **Global Periods**: Surgical bundling and follow-up management
- **Observation vs Inpatient**: Status-dependent benefit application

### Edge Case Management

- **Accumulator Programs**: Copay assistance impact tracking

## Data Models

### Payer Profile Schema

Each payer profile includes:

- **Identification**: Payer ID, name, type, plan structure
- **Benefit Design**: Deductibles, copays, coinsurance, OOP maximums
- **UM Rules**: Prior authorization, medical necessity, site steerage
- **Network**: In/out determination, NSA applicability
- **Formulary**: Tiers, step therapy, quantity limits
- **Appeals**: Process levels, timeframes, external review rights
- **Exclusions**: Experimental, cosmetic, custodial care definitions
- **Payment Models**: FFS, capitation, bundled, shared savings
- **Bonds**: Required financial guarantees and amounts

### Service Flow Processing

1. **Eligibility Verification**: Real-time 270/271 checking
2. **Authorization Assessment**: Service-specific requirement evaluation
3. **Medical Necessity Review**: Criteria application and documentation
4. **Network Validation**: Provider/facility status confirmation
5. **Benefit Calculation**: Cost-sharing determination
6. **COB Processing**: Primary/secondary coordination
7. **Claims Adjudication**: Edit application and payment calculation
8. **Appeals Management**: Multi-level review process

## Implementation Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Select Payer Profiles**: Choose relevant payer configurations
2. **Configure Rule Engine**: Load applicable business rules
3. **Set Up Questionnaires**: Deploy feedback collection
4. **Implement NSA Calculator**: Enable patient protection
5. **Configure Denial Management**: Set up appeal workflows

### Integration Points

- **EMR Systems**: Clinical data integration
- **Clearinghouses**: EDI transaction processing
- **PBMs**: Pharmacy benefit coordination
- **Quality Systems**: HEDIS/Stars measure calculation
- **Financial Systems**: Cost accounting and reporting

### Customization

- **Payer-Specific Rules**: Override default configurations
- **Clinical Protocols**: Institution-specific guidelines
- **Workflow Adaptations**: Role-based process modifications
- **Reporting Requirements**: Custom analytics and dashboards

## Edge Cases and Gotchas

### Hidden Complexity

- **Definition Drift**: Medical necessity criteria changes quarterly
- **Policy Carve-outs**: Same plan, different benefits by setting
- **Transplant Networks**: Separate directories and criteria
- **Accumulator Programs**: Silent patient liability changes
- **Global Period Traps**: Follow-up visit denials
- **Retroactive Terminations**: Coverage claw-backs

### Critical Validations

- **Auth Status**: Required but not approved → Block
- **Observation Mismatch**: Inpatient benefits on obs status → Flag
- **Modifier Conflicts**: 26/TC site-of-service alignment → Validate
- **NSA Scenarios**: OON provider protection → Calculate correctly
- **Formulary Steps**: Prior auth and step therapy → Route appropriately
- **COB Sequencing**: Primary/secondary order → Process correctly

## Stakeholder Map

### Direct Participants

- **Patients/Members**: Care recipients and financial responsibility holders
- **Providers**: Physicians, hospitals, ancillaries, specialists
- **Payers**: Health plans, employers, TPAs, PBMs, stop-loss carriers

### Regulatory Bodies
