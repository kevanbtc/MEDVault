### 🏗️ Technical Architecture

**Backend (Node.js/Express)**
```
/api/money   - NSA calculator & GFE generation
/api/prices  - Hospital pricing & site comparison  
/api/bills   - Bill auditing & dispute letters
/api/drugs   - Drug pricing & HSA/FSA validation
/api/scripts - Template generation
```

**Frontend (React/Tailwind)**
```
MoneyTab/
├── PatientPlaybook.js    - Main overview & quick actions
├── NSACalculator.js      - Protection analysis tool
├── PriceTransparency.js  - Hospital pricing search
├── BillAuditor.js        - Bill analysis & disputes  
├── DrugComparator.js     - Prescription price comparison
└── apiService.js         - Centralized API client
```

### 📚 Regulatory Compliance & Sources

All functionality backed by primary sources:
- **Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services** (NSA & Price Transparency)
- **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau** (Medical Debt Collection)
- **IRS Section 501(r)** (Nonprofit Hospital Requirements)
- **Peer-reviewed research** (Drug pricing effectiveness)

### 🧪 Testing & Validation

- ✅ **Server Tests**: All API endpoints functional (Jest/Supertest)
- ✅ **API Validation**: Real endpoints tested with curl
- ✅ **Data Flow**: Complete request/response cycle verified
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error responses and validation

### 🚀 Deployment Ready

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm run install:all

# Start development servers  
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

### 🎯 Impact & Differentiation

This platform implements the **complete workflow** described in the problem statement:

**Plan** → Import benefits + network + prior-auth rules  
**Shop** → Hospital price estimator + payer rules + site-of-service switch  
**Lock** → Generate GFE + store proof + capture pre-auth  
**Fill** → Compare cash vs insurance with accumulator warnings  
**Visit** → NSA eligibility check + block surprise-bill consent  
**Bill** → Itemized audit vs GFE + auto-draft negotiation + CFPB escalation

### 🏆 Key Differentiators

1. **Regulatory Foundation**: Built on actual NSA, CMS, and CFPB requirements
2. **Evidence Capture**: Screenshot saving, citation tracking, dispute documentation  
3. **Automated Workflows**: Pre-filled scripts, auto-generated letters, regulatory citations
4. **Real Data**: Hospital machine-readable pricing files, not estimates
5. **Patient Advocacy**: CFPB talking points, charity care requirements, appeal processes

## 📊 Demonstration Results

All core APIs tested and functional:
- NSA Calculator: ✅ Protection analysis working
- Price Transparency: ✅ Hospital data retrieval working  
- Bill Auditor: ✅ Analysis and dispute generation working
- Drug Comparator: ✅ Multi-source price comparison working
- Script Templates: ✅ Automated letter generation working

**Status: COMPLETE** 🎉

This transforms healthcare cost-saving from suggestions into **enforceable default paths** with full regulatory backing.
